# Overview

My first project assignment? Hello World.

This assignment is just to make sure that we know how to use Git. I'm also required to upload a video that goes over running the code. Today, it's just going to be a simple video,
but I really hope to show everyone some cool stuff in the coming weeks.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Community Edition, 2022. I used this instead of VS Code because it comes with a built-in compiler. I'm considering trying out JetBrains Rider, but we'll see.

Visual Studio comes with a pre-built C++ Command Line project with Hello World in main. I added a line for input so the .exe would stay open. It doesn't care what the input is as long as it's
something.

The easiest way to build the code is with the Visual Studio compiler. But if you want to use a compiler of your own, then go for it.

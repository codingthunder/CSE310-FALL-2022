# Overview

Hi everyone! I'm JC. I'm a professional .NET backend developer. I'm also a hobbyist video game dev who primarily focuses on Unity, but I'm looking to pick up Unreal Engine.
I really enjoy so many aspects of software development. I've been playing around with breadboard circuits to teach myself logic gates, I've been poking around with
deep learning AI, and I taught myself Python a couple years ago so that I could teach the language as an instructor for Delaware STEAM Academy, just to name a few different things.

I'm not supposed to say this, but I am doing this project/repo for a college class. See, I've done a lot in my life that I'm proud of. I have been supremely blessed
with a wonderful wife, a good job, and decent health. But something I've always regretted was not finishing that college degree. More importantly, I desire the 
extra job security that a degree provides. I've been poor before. It sucks, and I'll do whatever it takes to ensure my wife never has to worry about finances again.

So, I am back in college. I'd love to have anyone who finds this to come along for the ride with me. My goal for this class is to really stretch my skillset. To that end,
I've decided to pick up C++ again to learn Unreal Engine and really dive deep into some more nitty-gritty subjects. This hasn't been approved yet, but I'd love
to do a basic project writing in DirectX 12. It's been a few years since I last touched C++, so my first goal is to just reacquaint myself with the syntax and
memory management.

My first project assignment? Hello World.

This assignment is just to make sure that we know how to use Git. I'm also required to upload a video that goes over running the code. Today, it's just going to be a simple video,
but I really hope to show everyone some cool stuff in the coming weeks.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Community Edition, 2022. I used this instead of VS Code because it comes with a built-in compiler. I'm considering trying out JetBrains Rider, but we'll see.

Visual Studio comes with a pre-built C++ Command Line project with Hello World in main. I added a line for input so the .exe would stay open. It doesn't care what the input is as long as it's
something.

The easiest way to build the code is with the Visual Studio compiler. But if you want to use a compiler of your own, then go for it.
